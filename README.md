A simple Spotify app that takes selects randomly from among your Spotify playlists and analyzes it. It then adds to that playlist a song that best represents the average attributes of the playlist, as given by the EchoNest database. Then, via SMS through the Trilio service, it sends a command to your Android device that changes its background to the album artwork for that average song. The album artwork is obtained through the Gracenote database.
